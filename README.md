# Overview

This project explores a real Netflix dataset containing movies and TV shows added to the platform from 2008 to 2021, with some titles dating as far back as 1925.
Using Python, I cleaned the data, analyzed patterns, and created clear visual insights.

The goal is simple:
* Understand what kind of content Netflix adds
* Explore genres, ratings, and countries
* Find trends over the years
* Practice essential data cleaning and visualization skills
